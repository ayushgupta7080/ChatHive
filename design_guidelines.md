# Design Guidelines Not Applicable

## Project Scope
This is a **backend-only Node.js server project** with no frontend, UI, or visual components.

The user explicitly requested:
- No UI
- No frontend
- No React
- No Vite
- Backend code setup only

## Conclusion
**Design guidelines are not applicable** to this project as it consists solely of:
- Express server (`index.js`)
- Socket.io real-time communication
- Mongoose database models
- CORS middleware
- Bcrypt utilities
- Package dependencies (`package.json`)

There are no visual elements, user interfaces, or interactive components that require design specifications.

If a frontend is added to this project in the future, design guidelines can be generated at that time based on the specific frontend requirements and technology stack.
